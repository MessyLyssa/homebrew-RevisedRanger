# MessyLyssa's Revised Classes: Ranger

A JSON Converted Version of my Homebrewed Ranger Class, designed for use on 5e.Tools.

## Documentation

This repository is used to maintain information regarding my complete overhaul homebrew to the Ranger Class for D&D 5E and 2024 Edition.

It combines elements of the core rules, revisions created by other Homebrew Authors, as well as my own personal changes and desires for this class.

Being a rare Ranger Class Fan, I wanted this class to represent what I feel is the best archetype for a Ranger, including subclasses addressing other subtypes of Rangers, bringing back the use of a community through Conclaves, and hopefully with enough flexibility for you to create your dream Ranger.

There will also be an update on spells, however I am only providing the spells that I am adding, as well as revising. Spells that are updates to current SRD and related source spells, will be noted as a replacement for its original.
